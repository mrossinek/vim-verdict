INTRODUCTION                                     *verdict*

|verdict| is a plugin to help you write prose in a VCS-friendly fashion.
Its design ideas stem from this blog post:
  http://dustycloud.org/blog/vcs-friendly-patchable-document-line-wrapping/
The idea is ensure meaningful diffs while still allowing hard line-wrapping.
This is achieved by ensuring the following syntax:

  1. every sentence starts on a new line
  2. no line should exceed the |textwidth| limit
  3. if a sentence is continued on the next line, it is visually indented

By sticking to these three principles, we can ensure meaningful diffs since
  even hard-wrapped lines will result in diffs on a per-sentence (and not
  per-paragraph) basis.
Furthermore, we even benefit from a better structural presentation of work
  through the additional indentation at inner-sentence linebreaks.

USAGE                                            *verdict-usage*

Since the functionality provided by |verdict| can be seen as rather
  restrictive to some use-cases, it is not enabled by default for any
  filetype.
Therefore, in order to use it, you must enable it explicitly where
  appropriate.
You can do so by calling |verdict#Init()|.
You may also deactivate again with the corresponding |verdict#Deinit()|
  function.

After you have activated |verdict| you will have the following functionality
  at your disposal:

  1. Automatic indentation in insert mode (via |indentexpr|)
  2. Formatting with the help of |gq|`{motion}` (via |formatexpr|)

Note: I recommend using the plugin https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc
  which allows you to use local `.lvimrc` files to specify additional settings
  on a project-basis.
This will allow you to automatize the initialization of |verdict| where you
  need it on a regular basis.
You could for example add a single `.lvimrc` file to the root of your website,
  notes directory or tex project.

CONFIGURATION                                    *verdict-configuration*

*g:verdict_loaded*                          `Default: 0`
Set this boolean to 1 in order to disable the plugin.

*g:verdict_sentence_delims*                `Default: .!?`
This string contains all symbols that delimit a sentence and, thus, will cause
  a hard linebreak.

*g:verdict_sentence_suffixes*              `Default: )]}"''`
This string contains all symbols that may follow any of delimiters after the
  end of the sentence.
These symbols may come in any number and order and will not be broken onto the
  next line.

*g:verdict_default_textwidth*              `Default: 80`
This variable defines the default textwidth value used when the |textwidth| is
  set to 0.

*g:verdict_overwrite_shiftwidth*           `Default: <None>`
Set this variable to a desired value which will be used to overwrite the
  current |shiftwidth| setting upon initialization.
